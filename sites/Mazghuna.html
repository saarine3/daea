      <h1>Mazghuna</h1>
      <h3>Middle Kingdom - 12th Dynasty</h3>
	  <h4>By: Drake Saarinen</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Originally explored by Ernest Mackay in 1910, Mazghuna wasn’t excavated until 1911 by Flinders Petrie. The site has been dated to the 12th Dynasty of the Middle Kingdom. What was uncovered was a set of unfinished Pyramids that are believed to have belonged to Amenemhet IV. The Pyramids themselves were never completely finished and never actually used as burial chambers. The Northern Pyramid was abandoned so early in its construction that its superstructure was never actually started. Although neither were completed they both had finished monolithic burial chambers complete with quartzite slabs at the ready to seal their respective entrances. (Landua-McCormik,217-225) </p>

		 <h3>Region and Geographical setting</h3>

		 <p>Mazghuna is about 35km south of Cairo the two pyramids are located about 40m apart. The area they exist in is a few kilometers into the dessert so the surrounding land is mostly rolling sands and limestone fragments left from older projects. There are some palms and foliage spotted about. There is are two hills that stands out from the rest of the smaller rolling hills which are the location of the two pyramid sites.</p>
		 <br>
		 <h3>Site Description</h3>
		 <p> Mazghuna is a site this is most notably known for its two Pyramids. The site is located about 5km south of Dahshur. The two pyramids are known as the north and southern pyramids which are located 40m apart. The southern pyramid today is looks nothing more than a small hill. When examined closer there is a large underground chamber that was made to be a burial tomb. The site is an essentially limestone chippings that are surrounded by easily movable sand. These Limestone chipping are what first drew Mackay to the location in 1910. The substructure is truly an amazing labyrinth. The dimensions of the pyramid are 52.5m in length which can be used to assume the length of all sides. The site is however to incomplete to be able to determine the height the pyramid would have been, or how much material was supposed to be used for its sloping sides. The base is made out by trenches 202 inches wide and 39 inches deep. This trench spans the entire base of the pyramid. In the middle of the square trench is the tombs pit. The inner wall of the trench is covered with mud and white washed. The floor of the trench is made out of large limestone blocks many of which are heavily damaged. The internal square of the trench or what remains of it is composed of mud bricks and gravel. This was supposed to be the base of the pyramid. None of the exterior plaster remains, although it is assumed that it would have been covered with a limestone casing. The southern wall holds the entrance to the chamber which is followed by a staircase which leads to a small chamber with a stone that can be moved to block the entrance. After the first chamber is another staircase which leads to again a small chamber. After the second chamber there is a much larger U-shaped chamber that leads to the location of the burial chamber. The whole labyrinth is not too dissimilar to the shape of a question mark.(Lehner)</p>

		<p>The northern pyramid is located about 40m or a quarter mile north of the Southern Pyramid. The northern pyramid is also known as the second pyramid of Mazghuna simply because of the order Mackay discovered/explored them. The physical description of the northern pyramid is much different from the southern pyramid because there is almost no trace of the superstructure above ground. However the side length was later determined as 52.5m. The site is identified by a small cemetery in the center of it. Again limestone chips covered the surrounding area. There is almost no trench or superstructure of any kind. There are no limestone blocks or plaster remains of the superstructure. The site is almost entirely based off the tomb and its chambers. One of the eastern trenches hold a sloping entrance with steps leading to the labyrinth, but the main entrance is on the north side. There is believed to have been an entrance to the north but its condition was too poor to determine for sure. The entrance is composed of a staircase that leads to the first small chamber which then turns right into a much longer downward staircase. The chamber layout is complicated from this point out and changes directions six times. The main chamber has a framed roof and a large sarcophagus case made of quartz.(Landua-McCormik,217-237)</p>

		<h3>Excavations and Results</h3>
		<p>As mentioned previously the site was excavated by Ernest Mackay in 1910, while he initially looked around and measured the sites he never fully explored them and mapped them out. The job was then picked up by Flinders Petrie the following year in 1911. When Mackay went explored the location he did not excavate them. Petrie was the man who went into the locations and cataloged all the artifacts from the pyramids and the surrounding cemeteries. For the south pyramid he concluded by his finding was that the base and the super structure resemble the pyramid at Hawara in its construction techniques and its building materials. Due to the way that the superstructure is build it is believed that they were built under Amenemhet IV although this is only a theory and there is no actual documentation that backs up this information. Another theory that was developed behind this idea was that the way the burial chamber was constructed is very similar to the fashion that Amenemhet IV had built.(Petrie, 41-50)</p> 
		<br>
		<p>The north pyramid there is the overall idea that the way the super structure is composed isn’t too dissimilar from that of the northern. There are some notable differences however. This pyramid was larger than the southern pyramid. There is evidence to suggest that the construction can be attributed to Queen Sobekneferu. Having only ruled for a short while she is uncertain where her relationship to Amenemhet IV was, but it is believed that she was either a half-sister or a consort to him, or possible both. It is worth noting that compared to the southern pyramid the north pyramid is much less complete yet the aspirations of the original builder was one that made the design much more complicated than the other. So had it been completed it would have been one of the most advanced pyramids of the time in terms of technology implemented and building techniques. (Petrie 50-55)</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p> Mazghuna is a site that from the outside looks like simply a pile of rocks and sand. When Mackay visited the site this is initially what was assumed the location to be. With the discovery of the trenches and super structures the site peaked his interest. Later when Petrie came to the location the super structures were investigated further.  Later when the two locations were identified as pyramids and the tombs were cleared out that the site was dated to the middle kingdom and later linked to Amenemhet IV. All and all the sites present a great example of the agriculture of the middle kingdom as well as the economic situations that was happening at the time. The incomplete structures are a testament to the way the social problems, internal, and external affairs were during this time period.</p>
