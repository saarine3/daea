The archaeological remains that were discovered illustrate several types of continued occupation at the site. A large stone quarry, rock-cut tombs used as necropolis and an enclosed mud-brick settlement were all found within the boundaries. George Wilkinson, Robert Hay, Nestor L’Hote and Bonomi traveled the Gebel el-Haridi region during the nineteenth century.

The Kom Ombo basin was clearly occupied throughout those time periods. The most significant discovery on the site was the Temple of Kom Ombo. This temple, on top of being relatively well preserved, is also special because it is dually dedicated to the gods Sobek and Horus. It is one of the few temples divided in half with one side in worship of a deity and the other parallel half being dedicated to another. Also found within the site were remnants of ancient caravan routes, New Kingdom blocks, and well preserved reliefs. Jacques de Morgan in 1893 and Edmun Vignard in the 1920’s were two of the prominent excavators and researchers of Kom Ombo and the temple. Morgan primarily cleared the temple of debris, and Vignard discovered important prehistoric sites. ",<a href="#">MORE DETAILS</a>

The site has been dated to the 12th Dynasty of the Middle Kingdom. What was uncovered was a set of unfinished Pyramids that are believed to have belonged to Amenemhet IV. The Pyramids themselves were never completely finished and never actually used as burial chambers. The Northern Pyramid was abandoned so early in its construction that its superstructure was never actually started. Although neither were completed they both had finished monolithic burial chambers complete with quartzite slabs at the ready to seal their respective entrances.",<a href="sites/Mazghuna.html">MORE DETAILS</a>
